<h2> About Kobe </h2>

The center of Kansai (Osaka bay area) consists of three big cities,
which are Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe.  These three cities are in commuting
distance and each city has different characters.  To come to Kobe from
abroad, we recommend to take a direct flight which arrives at the
Osaka (Kansai) international airport (KIX) and take a limousine bus to Sannomiya
(downtown of Kobe).  

<p>

Kobe</a>,

<h2> Access </h2>
<h3> Preparations </h3>
We recommend you to make money exchanges at the airport.  Rates are the same with banks in downtown.
You can also make money exchanges in some banks in Sannomiya area 
(<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.694075,135.19416"> google map </a>).
Most bank ATM's will not accept your ATM card,
but cashing machines of credit card companies may accept your card.
(Please check on these things for your bank or card companies.)
You can find cashing machines at Sannomiya area.
The "Sannomiya center street" is a shoping mall with a roof. 
The entrace is located south of the sannomiya station and is near the building with the sign OIOI
Kobe Marui.
The entrance has a sign "Sannomiya center street" in English.
Banks and cashing machines are near the entrance. <p>
The ATM machine at the Seven eleven (south of the No.25 building of the campus map) 
in the campus will accept your credit card.
<p>
Japan uses AC power plugs of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets"> type A</a>, 
which is also used in US. 
The voltage is 100V.
Most laptop computers will work with 100V, 
but it is hard to buy a plug converter from other types to the type A, once you have arrived in Japan.
Do not forget to bring a plug converter!


<h3> How to come to Kobe downtown (Sannomiya)?</h3>

If you arrive at the Kansai (Osaka) international airport (KIX),
take a limousine bus to Kobe (Sannomiya).
The bus stops near the Sannomiya station.

Note 1:
If you firstly come to the university, we recommend to take a taxi
from Hankyu Rokko station. The cost will be about 680yen
(small sized car).
If you share the taxi with other participants, it will be cheaper than
taking a bus (200yen).
The campus is big and the taxi driver needs to know which place he should go.
<font color="red"> Show <a href="../for-taxi.png"> this map and instruction </a> to the driver </font>.
<br>
Note 2:
Ticket vending machines work with the order
(1) insert money (2) press the ticket price or the destionation
(3) issue a ticket.
The order is not (2), (1), (3), which is common in Europe and in north
America. <br>
Note 3:
Any city bus has a money changing machine, which accept 1,000 yen bills. 
It does not accept 5,000 yen or 10,000 yen bills. <br>
Note 4:
Buses (line 36) from Hankyu Rokko station might be very crowded. 
In this case it will be a good idea to take a bus of line 36 from
JR Rokko-michi station 
where you can go from Sannomiya by the JR line.
The bus will bring you to Kobe university via the Hankyu Rokko station.
If the nearest station of your hotel is JR Kobe or JR Motomachi,
it will be good to take the bus of line 36 from JR Rokko-michi station.
