<h2> Session title</h2> Number theoretical software

<h2> Organizers </h2> 
Ken Nakamula (Tokyo Metropolitan University)<br>
Michael Pohst (TU-Berlin)<br>
Shigenori Uchiyama (Tokyo Metropolitan University) <br>

<h2> Keywords </h2>  
development, applications, interchangeability

<h2> Description </h2>

 This session is organized to discuss any kind of topics on
software related to number theory.  One main subject is on
development of system or program for number theory.  Another
main subject is on application of number theoretical software
not only in number theory but also in any other area such as
algebraic geometry, group theory, combinatorics, graph theory,
coding theory or cryptology.  Discussion on interchangeability
of problems between development and application will also be
welcome.
