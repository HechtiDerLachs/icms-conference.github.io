<h2> Description </h2>

Groebner Bases methods are one of the central tools in modern  
computer algebra.
They are widely used in many different contexts
with field of application ranging from pure mathematics
like algebraic geometry to industrial and economical applications.
In this session, we discuss any topics related with Groebner bases
and their applications (see also Keywords).
