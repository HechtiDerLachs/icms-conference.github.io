<h2> Description </h2>

Computational Group Theory is a branch of computer algebra. It is
concerned with the developement of algorithms to investigate and classify
groups and the application of such algorithm in areas like number theory,
graph theory or cryptography. GAP, Magma and Sage are software systems which
incorporate many methods for such purposes.  The session `Computational Group
Theory' is organised to discuss any aspects replated to computations with
finite or infinite groups.
