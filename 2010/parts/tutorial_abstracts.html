<h2> Abstracts of Software Tutorials</h2>

<h3>An introduction of ICMS-DVDs</h3>

<p>
We are preparing ICMS-DVDs for participants of ICMS2010.
DVD1 is KNOPPIX/Math. It is a project to archive free mathematical
software and documents and offer them
on KNOPPIX, a Live-DVD that contains a collection of GNU/Linux software.
DVD2 is not a Live-DVD, it is a collection of binaries of mathematical
software, source codes, documents and movies.
It contains virtual machine of KNOPPIX/Math and small Debian based
virtual machines for some matematical applications.
I will introduce these DVDs.

<h3>Risa/Asir</h3>

<p>
Risa/Asir is a computer algebra system mainly for polynomials
with the OpenXM functionality to integrate with other systems.
It has been developed in the Fujitsu laboratory in 1990's and in Kobe
University in 2000's.
We will present an overview of the system, history of the developement,
and hints to utilize it for developers.

<h3> The Sage mathematics software system </h3>

<p>
A brief tutorial for Sage (<a href="http://sagemath.org">http://sagemath.org</a>).  We will demonstrate
the web-based
"notebook" interface and the Cython programming language, followed by
a whirlwind tour of the components of Sage and the functionality
provided by each.


<h3>NZMATH --- a practical number theoretic tool</h3>

<p>
NZMATH is a Python based number theory oriented calculation system.  We
will demonstrate some number theoretic calculations on IPython. After
that we will introduce features of NZMATH and show how to install the
system on your PC.

<h3>GNU TeXmacs</h3>

GNU TeXmacs is a free wysiwyw (what you see is what you want) editing platform
with special features for scientists. The software aims to provide a unified and
user friendly framework for editing structured documents with different types
of content (text, graphics, mathematics, interactive content, etc.).
The rendering engine uses high-quality typesetting algorithms so as to
produce professionally looking documents, which can either be printed out
or presented from a laptop.

<p>
The software includes a text editor with support for mathematical formulas,
a small technical picture editor and a tool for making presentations from a laptop.
Moreover, TeXmacs can be used as an interface for many external systems for
computer algebra, numerical analysis, statistics, etc. New presentation styles can
be written by the user and new features can be added to the editor using the Scheme
extension language. A native spreadsheet and tools for collaborative authoring
are planned for later.


<h3>CHomP - Computational Homology Project</h3>

<p>
The CHomP software (<a href="http://chomp.rutgers.edu/">http://chomp.rutgers.edu/</a>) is primarily aimed at the
computation of homology groups of low-dimensional cubical sets, that is,
polyhedra in R^n built of cells with respect to a fixed rectangular grid. In
addition to a C++ programming library, the software package contains programs
addressed to non-programmers, all under the terms of the GNU GPL.

<h3>Towards a Non-Hirsch-Polytope via polymake</h3>

Paco Santos recently disproved the long-standing Hirsch Conjecture.
His (first)
counter-example is a 43-dimensional simple convex polytope with 86
facets whose
vertex-edge graph has diameter at least 44.  The latter exceeds the
Hirsch bound
of 86-43=43.  This tutorial explains the construction using polymake.

<h3>iscc</h3>

<p>
iscc is an interactive tool for manipulating sets and relations of
integer tuples bounded by affine constraints as well as quasipolynomials
defined over such domains.  Essentially, the tool serves as a high-level
interface to isl, barvinok and CLooG.  The tutorial first illustrates
some basic concepts and operations such as code generation, lexicographic
optimization, (weighted) counting and the computations of bounds on
quasipolynomials through the use of small examples that only require
a single or a few operations.  In the second part, a number of small
applications are discussed that require a sequence of basic operations.
All examples are inspired by the polyhedral model for program analysis
and transformation.
