<h2> OVERVIEW </h2>

<p>
This congress is the third in the series, where the first meeting was held in
Beijing in 2002 and the previous one in Castro Urdiales, SPAIN in 2006; see
http://www.icms2006.unican.es/ . The first two meetings were satellite events
to ICM (International Congress of Mathematicians). We will have a presentation
booth at ICM 2010 in India. <br><br>

ICMS 2010 will take place at the Department of Mathematics, Kobe University, 
Kobe, Japan, September 13 to 17 (Monday to Friday), 2010.

<p>
We will welcome developers of mathematical software systems as well as
researchers in algorithms and mathematicians who are interested in the
development of mathematical software and systems. This is an almost unique
chance to meet people in different disciplines in mathematics and computer
science and exchange ideas on developments on mathematical software and
systems. While the main audience of this meeting is assumed to be developers of
mathematical software and software systems, we welcome the participation of
mathematicians and scientists who are interested in using mathematical software
for their research.

<p>
The proceedings of the congress is planned and all reviewed papers and short
communications will be published as Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
(The proceedings of ICMS 2006 was published as LNCS Volume 4151.)
