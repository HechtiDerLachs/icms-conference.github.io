title: ICMS 2024 - Call for Session Proposals
---


The _8th International Congress on Mathematical Software_ will consist of several topical sessions. Each session will provide an overview of the challenges, achievements and progress in a subfield of mathematical software research, development and use. The program committee will consist of the session organizers. We solicit session proposals.

For inspiration, have a look at the sessions of past ICMS:
[ICMS 2020](http://www.iaa.tu-bs.de/AppliedAlgebra/ICMS2020/ICMS2020_Sessions.html),
[ICMS 2018](/2018/sessions).


**You are invited to propose a session if you**

*   are active in mathematical software research, development and use,
*   want to serve the research community by nurturing and facilitating mathematical software work in your area, and
*   would like to focus only on the scientific matters in the organization (not on other matters such as administrative, logistic, etc).

**How to propose a session**

1.  Prepare a session proposal with the following contents.

    *   title of the session
    *   name(s) of the organizer(s), with contact addresses and emails
    *   aim and scope of the session (at most 150 words)

2.  Submit it

    *   to one of the program chairs:
    [Kevin Buzzard](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.buzzard),
    [Bettina Eick](http://www.iaa.tu-bs.de/beick),
    [Anton Leykin](https://antonleykin.math.gatech.edu)
    *   or to the General Chair:
    [Alicia Dickenstein](https://mate.dm.uba.ar/~alidick)
    *   at latest by 17 November 2023.

3.  The decision on the proposal will be made

    *   by the program chair, the general chair and the advisory committee
    *   by 4 December 2023

**How to organize a session**

*   Maintain a session web page (see template in [html-format](/2020/icms_session_2020) or [markdown-format](/2020/icms_session_2020.txt)).
*   Send a call for short abstracts (about 200 words) to the potential speakers in the topic area of the session.
*   Review the submitted abstracts and make decision on their acceptance, as soon as each one arrives.
*   Post accepted short abstracts on the session web page.
*   Complete the process by 24 February 2024
*   During the meeting: manage the session, and arrange for chair(s) for each time slot.

Extended abstracts for the proceedings may be submitted via EasyChair (by 16 March 2024; details TBA) by those who were accepted as speakers in any session.
Session organisers can have papers themselves (acceptance agreed by an appropriate programme chair).

**Format of a session**

*   A session will consist of one or more time slots.
*   A time slot will consist of 2 talks (of 25+5 minutes)
*   We encourage that each session begins with one general overview talk (may be given by a session organizer).

"Talks" may also include software presentations.
Demos aiming at a wide audience should submitted to the Software Fair.

**Possible topics for sessions**

*   These are _not_ exclusive. You can propose any mathematical topic.
*   These are _not_ required titles of sessions. You can propose any title.
*   These are provided as initial hint for topics and titles.
