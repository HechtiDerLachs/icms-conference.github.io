With the wide-spread availability of high-speed internet,
an HTML-based system is one of the most promising options
for mathematical software in this post COVID-19 era.
While many web-based software libraries are available
for specific purposes, including ones for symbolic calculations
and dynamic visualizations, extra elaboration is needed
to integrate their capabilities so that users can perform
mathematical activities on a single HTML content.

Moreover, it seems that the realities and benefits derived from
the use of those systems have not yet been fully investigated.
Especially in the complex case of statistics learning, more precise
knowledge about them will likely help maximize the effect of
using newly developed systems. This research is mainly concerned
with the use of our newly developed system for the learning
of the $\chi^2$ test for independence.
Through the comparative study of the log of simulations,
which learners performed on the HTML content between
experimental and control groups, it has been shown that
some restrictions to the context of its use can have
a large influence on learners' thinking.
