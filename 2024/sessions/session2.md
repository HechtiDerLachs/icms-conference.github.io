### Aim and Scope
Interactive proof assistants (ITPs) are pieces of software that allow one to express mathematical constructs and arguments and check them interactively. Formalisation, the process of writing mathematical proofs in these systems, is becoming increasingly popular amongst mathematicians. This session will showcase projects bridging the gap between ITPs and other kinds of mathematical software and computation. There are many aspects of this which could be explored further.Â  For example; tactics for ITPs which make use (and verify) witnesses extracted from unverified computation; code extraction, allowing formalised algorithms to be used for computer algebra; proof discovery and visualisation tools within ITPs which make use of external mathematical software; using proof assistants to check key reductions in computer algebra; or interfaces between ITPs and SAT/SMT solvers to verify completely automated proofs. We hope that this session will foster collaboration among people working in formalisation, computer algebra, and other areas of mathematical computation.
