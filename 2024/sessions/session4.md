### Aim and Scope
Recent years have shown new applications of symbolic methods in computer algebra at scale. For instance, previously deemed impossible classification algorithms from toric and tropical geometry result in terabyte sized data sets.  This calls for the development of new algorithms, allowing --for example-- for parallelization, but also new high level user interfaces. The aim is to bring together experts in computational algebraic geometry and those who want to use newly provided methods and algorithms in their research endeavors. We encourage speakers to highlight the computational aspects of their work and to augment their presentation with code examples. Our focus includes valuable application of these methods in physics, particularly in string theory and F-theory.
