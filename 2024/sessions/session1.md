### Organizers
   * [John Abbott (RPTU Kaiserslautern, Germany)](mailto:john:abbott@rptu.de) but replace the colon by a dot<br/>

### Aim and Scope
Number theory underlies many techniques for symbolic computation, and also in several neighbouring disciplines such as modern cryptography & cryptanalysis.  In this session we shall see and discuss various state-of-the-art implementations as well as bring together researchers with varied applications and using different software systems. Topics may include, but are not limited to, certificates of correctness of computational results (e.g. primality certification), algebraic field extensions, local fields, arithmetic geometry.  Details about important implementation techniques are also encouraged (e.g. exploiting parallellism, new empirically-confirmed complexity results, adroit use of approximation).

### Submission guidelines
 If you would like to give a talk please send your title and short abstract to the session organiser <b>as soon as possible</b>, and anyway by <b>24th February 2024</b>.  The short abstract will be posted on this web page once accepted.

There is an option to submit an _extended abstract_ for 
      the conference proceedings in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science
      to accompany the talk.  This will be reviewed and if accepted, 
      distributed during the meeting and online via Springer. The deadline to 
      submit to these proceedings is **22nd March 2024.**  Details on page
      limits, style files and the submission link can be found on
      [the main ICMS webpage](https://maths.dur.ac.uk/icms2024/ICMS2024_Registration.html)
