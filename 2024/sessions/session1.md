### Organizers
   * [John Abbot (Kaiserslautern)](mailto:john.abbott@rptu.de)<br/>

### Aim and Scope
Number theory underlies many techniques for symbolic computation, and also in several neighbouring disciplines such as modern cryptography & cryptanalysis.  In this session we shall see and discuss various state-of-the-art implementations as well as bring together researchers with varied applications and using different software systems. Topics may include, but are not limited to, certificates of correctness of computational results (e.g. primality certification), algebraic field extensions, local fields, arithmetic geometry.  Details about important implementation techniques are also encouraged (e.g. exploiting parallellism, new empirically-confirmed complexity results, adroit use of approximation).
