### Organizers
   * [Jeroen Hanselman (RPTU Kaiserslautern, Germany)](https://hanselmanj.eu/)<br/>

### Aim and Scope

Computers have allowed mathematicians to do things that used to be practically impossible. Huge databases, complicated computer algebra packages, proof assistants and more and more computational tools have become crucial for doing mathematics.

This session aims to provide a mix of two important aspects of mathematical research data: The data itself and how to treat the data correctly. 

**Databases:**
The main topic of mathematical research data is of course, the data itself. The session will therefore show off various existing databases. Producing data for databases, the difficulties of managing a database, showing off the newest features of existing databases are all possible topics speakers could talk about. 

**FAIR data**
As research data becomes more important, we need to start thinking about how to handle the data. For this it is useful to talk about the concept of FAIR data. FAIR is short for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. In short, we want to talk about measures we can take to ensure that other mathematicians have access to the work we did and are actually able to reproduce our results and reuse them. It happens far too often that data that was produced, say, two years ago can no longer be used for a variety of potential reasons. The session will concern itself with a few solutions to address the current state of affairs.
