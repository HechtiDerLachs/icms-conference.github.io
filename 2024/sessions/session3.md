### Aim and Scope
Many combinatorial search and classification problems are computationally very challenging. It can be extremely helpful to use computational group theoretic techniques to exploit any symmetry in the problem as well as any possible symmetry in a solution. Such approaches must balance the group theoretic aspects and the combinatorial aspects. The fields we have in mind range from finite geometry to graph theory to design theory to coding theory and beyond. The session is about the software aspects of work in this field. Our goal is not so much to collect mathematical results, but rather to discuss the challenges along the way to finding new such results. We are interested in highlighting the challenges in the field of software development. Are there any new approaches? Are there new ways to use existing software? What languages are used successfully? Are there any new packages or systems? Are there any interesting new applications of group-theoretic or other algebraic techniques?
