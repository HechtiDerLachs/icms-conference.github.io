### Aim and Scope
Recent advances in computational algebraic geometry have expanded the approaches to solving polynomial equations and their applications. This session is aimed to showcase developments in a range of computational methods for studying problems in algebraic geometry. The primary goal is to offer insights for future research and encourage the development of related software. The scope includes the design of symbolic-numeric algorithms, applications in both pure and applied mathematics, rigorous certification of heuristic algorithms, and other applied methods within the realm of algebraic geometry.
