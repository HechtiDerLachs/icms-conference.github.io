### Organizers
   * [Janko Boehm (RPTU Kaiserslautern, Germany)](https://agag-jboehm.math.rptu.de/~boehm/)<br/>
   * [Anne Fruehbis-Krueger (Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Germany)](https://uol.de/anne-fruehbis-krueger)<br/>

### Aim and Scope
The session will highlight how these methods are transforming various areas of research in computer algebra. The core of our session will be the innovative use of massively parallel methods across different areas, with a specific focus on computational algebraic geometry and applications. In high energy physics, massively parallel methods are reshaping the way we approach multi-loop Feynman integral reduction in perturbative quantum field theory. Another focus will be on integrable systems, particularly regarding spin chains and the Bethe Ansatz equation. We also plan to touch the computation of generating series for Gromov-Witten invariants, as well as parallel algorithmic methods for algebraic schemes. The Computeralgebra/GPI-Space Framework, as an example of advanced software enabling massively parallel methods, will be mentioned in the context of its integration with computer algebra systems like Singular and OSCAR. The primary emphasis will be on the broader application and implications of massively parallel methods. The session would aim at six talks, each offering a distinct perspective on the current state of the art and future potential in computer algebra and applications. The organizers will give an introduction, setting the stage for a series of invited presentations.
