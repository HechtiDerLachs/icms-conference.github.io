title: "ICMS 2024 - Session 12: Polyhedral geometry and combinatorics</b>"
---
### Organizers
   * [Victoria Schleis (Universität Tuebingen, Germany)](https://victoriaschleis.github.io/)<br/>

### Aim and Scope

This session covers new developments in computational combinatorics and polyhedral geometry.
Particular topics include (but are not limited to) computational methods and new software developed in:<br/>
* polyhedral geometry,<br/>
* tropical geometry, in particular tropical intersection theory and methods on graphs,<br/>
* matroid theory, both purely combinatorial and in its interactions with other areas of mathematics, in particular polyhedral and algebraic geometry.<br/>

The aim of the session is to bring together researchers in different areas of polyhedral and tropical geometry and combinatorics, but also users of different software systems. Details about important implementation techniques are particularly encouraged!

## Submissions

We still have a few talk slots open. If you would be interested in giving a talk in this session, please reach out to me by February 28 with a title and short abstract for your talk!
