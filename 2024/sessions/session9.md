### Aim and Scope
In 1998 Smale published a list of 18 problems for the 21st century.  The sixth problem is to prove that for N points with positive masses the number of relative equilibria in the planar Newtonian N-body problem is finite up to  similarity transformations. Finiteness has been proved for N<5. For N=5 the result has been proved for generic choices of masses, with possible exceptional cases of masses described by polynomial equations. For higher N much less is known.  Some results have been found for related problems including relative equilibria of point vortices. A rich variety of computational algorithms play a key role in many arguments. This session is dedicated to discussing algorithms that will help providing results on relative equilibria in the N-body problem. Methods that may be discussed include Groebner bases, numerical system solving, real algebraic geometry methods, tropical and polyhedral arguments and interval arithmetic.
