has a wide variety of branches. Despite this, we in the
International Conference of Mathematical Software believe that
mathematics is fundamentally just one thing. Algebra,
geometry and analysis are examples of separate specialities within
mathematics, and of course we consider each of them valuable and hence
study them. But we take the view that any branch of mathematics can
borrow freely from these specialities. It is often worth while delving
into them for ideas that might lead to fundamental new discoveries. <br>
<br>
The
same can be said of mathematical software systems: the study of
mathematical software is a coherent whole. We believe that the
appearance of mathematical software is one of the most important events
in mathematics. Mathematical software systems are used to construct
examples, to prove theorems, and to find new mathematical phenomena.
Conversely, mathematical research often motivates developments of new
algorithms and new systems. Beyond mathematics, mathematical software
systems are becoming indispensable tools in many branches of science
and technology. The development of mathematical software systems relies
on the cooperation of mathematicians, algorithm designers, programmers,
and the feedback from users. The main audiences of this conference are
mathematical software developers and programming mathematicians, but we
also intend to provide an opportunity to discuss these topics with
mathematicians and users from application areas.</span><font size="+2"
