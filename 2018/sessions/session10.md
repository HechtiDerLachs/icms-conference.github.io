### Aim and Scope

The theme of this session is the user interfaces that mathematics researchers and learners 
use for reasoning, computing, and interacting with mathematical objects. Though recent 
developments in information technology have been improving the capability and efficiency of 
various interfaces for computation, visualization, and knowledge propagation, further 
refinement is needed for these interfaces to be fully utilized for mathematical activities. 
The exchange of knowledge and experience in the construction and practical use of mathematical 
interfaces would be helpful. Also, the unification of functionality throughout different 
interfaces may lead to deeper and wider applications. This session will bring together 
researchers, developers, and users of various mathematical web/mobile interfaces, computing 
environments, and scientific visualization tools to provide a forum for discussing common and 
distinct challenges and further developments. This session accepts papers that address related 
research and development and present new technologies. Papers exploring both research and 
educational experiences by using these technologies in an original way are also welcomed.
