## Session 2. Algorithms and applications for curves and surfaces ([Web page](http://mmrc.iss.ac.cn/~jcheng/ICMS2018.html))

### Organizers

*   [Jin-San Cheng](mailto:jcheng@amss.ac.cn) (Chinese Academy of Sciences, China)
*   [Vikram Sharma](mailto:vikram@imsc.res.in) (IMSc Chennai, India)

### Aim and Scope


Curves and Surfaces play a fundamental role in many fields, such as
Computational Geometry, Computer Aided Design, Computer Graphics,
Geometric Modeling to name a few. Consequently, softwares that provide
functionalities to handle them are very important. The aim of this
session is to facilitate communication between researchers who have
developed or plan to develop mathematical software related to implicit
or parametric curves and surfaces.  The softwares could be, for
instance, for handling arrangements of curves and surfaces, or
visualizing them, or computing their cell decomposition, or using them
as a tool in various applications. We welcome talks that highlight
some of the mathematical and algorithmic challenges that are faced in
designing softwares for curves and surfaces, and demonstrate some of
the recent advances made in this direction.

### Topics (including, but not limited to)

*   Algorithms for computing the topology of implicit curves and surfaces
*   Efficient algorithms for visualizing implicit curves and surfaces
*   Applications of curves and surfaces in scientific computing
*   Performing boolean operations (such as intersection, union, etc.) on curves and surfaces
