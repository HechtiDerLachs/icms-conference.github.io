## Session 15. Management of Mathematical Software, Mathematical Knowledge and Research Data

### Organizers

*   [Wolfram Sperber](mailto:wolfram@zbmath.org) (zbMATH)
*   [Patrick D. F. Ion](mailto:pion@umich.edu) (GDML WG & University of Michigan)

### Aim and Scope

The focus of the session will be on concepts, tools, and services
for handling, maintaining, and using mathematical software or
mathematical knowledge more generally. Mathematical software is
indispensible for scientific research but also plays a central role
mediating between mathematics and applications. It embodies a great
deal of mathematical knowledge, and sometimes directly requires
developing more. Key technologies use mathematical software for
computer simulations. But the development of an efficient
infrastructure for mathematical software is challenging: software
development is distributed, software has a life cycle, usage
conditions vary, and standards for handling of software information
are lacking. In addition, the incorporation of software into the
scientific record brings to the fore questions of replicability and
reproducibility that now extend to mathematical knowledge. With the
change in trust for science, and even within it, it is imperative
to have clear standards for truth and tools that support them.

### Topics

The session will cover different aspects and types of software
knowledge management, especially the development of standards,
tools, and services for software, concepts for content analysis,
and semantic interfaces.  These are requirements for both improved
facilities for search on mathematical software and automated,
semantically controlled, use of mathematics. The contexts for
mathematical software, especially models, algorithms, and data  
and its embedding into the existing information infrastructure of 
mathematics will be part of discussion. The aim to define the framework 
for best practices in mathematical software and knowledge management.
