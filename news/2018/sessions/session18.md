### Organizers

*   [Mikolas Janota](mailto:mikolas.janota@gmail.com) (IST, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal)
*   [Andrew Reynolds](mailto:andrew.j.reynolds@gmail.com) (University of Iowa, USA)

### Aim and Scope

The session aims at promoting discussion between researchers working on
automated solving of problems involving quantifiers.  Reasoning with
quantifiers is intrinsically hard. Indeed, adding quantification to a theory
typically leads to undecidability or to a much higher complexity class.
However, quantifiers are extremely important in modeling real-world problems.
In recent years there has been exciting progress in the research on
quantifier reasoning.  A number of novel solving paradigms can be found in
various domains. Prime examples are quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) and
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT).  While quantifiers have similar semantics
across different logics, the exchange between the different fields is limited.
It is the objective of this session to bring together researchers tackling
quantifiers from various angles.  We believe that promoting such discussion
enables mutual enrichment of the individual areas.

##### Topics (including, but not limited to)

*   satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)
*   quantifier elimination
*   quantified Boolean formula (QBF)
*   first/higher order logic (FOL/HOL)
*   quantified interpolants

### Journal Special Issue

*   A  _journal special issue_ consisting of _full papers_ will be organized immediately after the meeting.
*   After the meeting, the submission guideline for a journal special issue will be communicated to you by the session organizers.
