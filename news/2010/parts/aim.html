<h2> AIM AND SCOPE </h2>

<p>
Mathematics has a wide variety of branches. Despite this, we in the
International Congress on Mathematical Software believe that mathematics is
fundamentally just one thing. Algebra, geometry and analysis are examples of
separate specialities within mathematics, and of course we consider each of
them valuable and hence study them. But we take the view that any branch of
mathematics can borrow freely from these specialities. It is often worthwhile
delving into them for ideas that might lead to fundamental new discoveries.
The same can be said of mathematical software systems: the study of
mathematical software is a coherent whole. We believe that the appearance of
mathematical software is a fundamentally new event in mathematics of increasing 
importance. Mathematical software systems are used to construct examples, to 
prove theorems, and to find new mathematical phenomena. Conversely, mathematical
research often motivates developments of new algorithms and new systems. Beyond
mathematics, mathematical software systems are becoming indispensable tools in
many branches of science and technology. The development of mathematical
software systems relies on the cooperation of mathematicians, algorithm
designers, programmers, and the feedback from users. The main audience of this
congress is the community of mathematical software developers and programming
mathematicians, but we also intend to provide an opportunity to discuss these
topics with mathematicians and users from application areas. Topics include but
are not limited to:
<pre>
1. Design and implementation of mathematical software
2. Software engineering problems for mathematical software.
3. Mathematics and media including user interfaces and integration of documents
   and software systems.
4. Mathematics related to mathematical software (experiments, algorithms).
5. Scientific and high performance computing.
6. Applications of mathematical software.
