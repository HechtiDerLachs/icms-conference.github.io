<h2> Session title</h2> Computer tools for mathematical editing and scientific visualization

<h2> Organizers </h2>

<h2> Description </h2>

<p>
Computer tools for mathematical editing (such as scientific
editors, word processors, graphical editors, mathematical utilities for the
web and others) and for scientific artwork generation and visualization are
becoming common tools in today?s technological world. Today?s authors are
usually required to type scientific papers with embedded mathematical contents
and sophisticated pictures and other artwork in order to yield high-quality
camera-ready scientific documents and reports at full extent. As a
consequence, there is an increasing demand of computer solutions for
high-quality mathematical typesetting and editing and for generation,
manipulation and visualization of scientific artwork both in the academic
world and in many other publishing services.

<p>
The basic goal of this session is to open a forum for the exchange of ideas
and dissemination of ongoing projects regarding high-quality editing of
(either online or offline) mathematical documents and scientific
visualization. The emphasis is on computer tools that, either standalone or in
combination with others (in the form of plug-ins, libraries or similar), can
substantially enhance current programs' capabilities to generate high-quality
mathematical documents for pedagogical and scientific purposes. Preference
would be given to open-source projects and freeware developments aimed at
yielding low-cost materials. The session would accept papers addressing
research and development issues and presenting technologies oriented to
high-quality editing and printing of scientific materials with mathematical
content. Examples might include Latex extensions and libraries, WYSIWYG
mathematical editors and compilers, graphical extensions of computational
systems for scientific printout, standards and developments for mathematical
editing on the web, and so on. Papers exploring educational experiences by
using these technologies in an original way might also be acceptable.
