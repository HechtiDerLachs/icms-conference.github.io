# International Congress on Mathematical Software - ICMS 2020

The congress is organized in sessions, addressing different aspects of mathematical
software. There will be also demos, tutorials and posters. If you would like to give a
talk, you need to submit first a short abstract and then later an extended abstract to one
of the organizers of the corresponding session. Proceedings of ICMS 2020 will be published in the Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series.  See the [guidelines](/2020/submission-guidelines/) for the details.
